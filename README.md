This application provides a simple way of creating to do-style checklists.
The application's main page provides a list of all created to do lists, as
well as a button to add more. Clicking on the name of one such list will bring
the user to a page containing the items in that list, which can be checked or
unchecked. More items may be added to this list, again using the add button.
Delete and Archive functionality is accessed with a click-and-hold on the
relevant entry. A statistics page, as well as the archive and a function to send
the contents of the current screen via email can all be accessed via the action
bar menu. The archive does not allow editing, and is simply storage for old,
unwanted entries.
